#About SquidSlicer
SquidSlicer is a slicer program specifically for multi-material inkjet 3d printing of structural electronics. Models can be loaded as a STL format and are sliced into bitmaps, and support material can be automatically generated. 
Furthermore, the slicer contains circuit editing mode, in which circuit elements such as traces, components, vias etc can be added into the sliced model. These circuits layers do not have to be 
planar, but can be 2.5D, by placing the on sections of the model that are not flat. 
The slicer contains predicts how circuit layers are laid down on non-planar models, and determines the order in which the layers can be printed succesfully.

This slicer was developed by Martijn den Hoed as part of a Master's thesis.
